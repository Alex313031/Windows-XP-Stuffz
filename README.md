# Windows XP Stuffz &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Windows-XP-Stuffz/blob/main/old/xp_flag.png" width="36">

*Updates, programs, and files for Windows XP, some of which are hard to find because Microsoft took them down.*

### <ins>Files</ins>

__directx_Jun2010_redist.exe__ - Latest DirectX redistributable files for XP - 7.

__dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe__ - .NET Framework 4.0.3019 for both 32 and 64 bit.

__dotnetfx351.exe__ - .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1

__EXFAT_DRIVER.exe__ - Adds native EXFat support (reading, writing, formatting with the format dialog).

__F6_FLOPPY_FIX.txt__ - Describes how to use F6 floppy drivers during Windows setup with a USB floppy drive

__IE8_INSTALL.exe__ - Internet Explorer 8 x86 for Win XP.

__IE_8_CUMULATIVE.exe__ - Many I.E. updates in one WSU package.

__MP10Setup.exe__ - Windows Media Player 10, because some (like me) don't like WMP 11. This package is slightly different from the WMP10 still available in Microsoft's update catalog, as it is windows xp specific, which shows in the fact it is slightly larger than the one for vista.

__MSIEXEC_4.5.exe__ - Latest version of MSI installer (XP SP3 comes with 3.0)

__MTPPK12.exe__ - Backports MTP support to XP, note that It will not work at all with WMP9, Works for VIEWING only with WMP10, and that to have all features like write support to devices, you need WMP11. Hence, be careful with choosing this and the WMP10 package.

__ROOTS_UPDATER.zip__ - Program to update the root certificates (needed for Web Browsing and TLS) since they removed the server.

__rktools.exe__ - Windows 2003 resource kit tools, works just fine on XP, as there was never a resource kit for xp released publicly (though there was a small subset of these released in a small resource kit that one could order with a technet subscription).

__SysinternalsSuite.zip__ - Older version of sysinternals suite that still works with XP (approximated by using web.archive.org to find one with process explorer that would run on xp, and since I didn't look at ALL the snapshots, there may be slightly newer versions that work with xp, but anything after mid 2015 wont work for many of the tools)

__WANNACRY_PATCH.exe__ - The strange singular patch that Miscrosoft released years after XP's end of support, for the WannaCry vulnerability.

__WinXPPAE_v35.zip__ - Enables PAE on 32 bit XP

__WMITools.exe__ - Old WMI developer package. Works with 2000 and Vista, and 7 with compatability mode and opening the HTML based tools in IE (because it uses active content, blocked by modern browsers)

__XP_NET4_FIX.txt__ - Describes how to fix login hanging after installing .NET Framework 4

### <ins>Directories</ins>

__AwayMode__ - Drivers for "Away Mode" for Windows XP Media Center Edition, including an AMD "null" driver for other OSes.

__MSVC__ - Has all the Visual C++ Redistributables

__x64__ - Has copies of some of these files for 64 bit versions of XP and Server 2003. Also has the Windows MFM + PowerShell 2.0 update, as well as TweakUI for x64.

__reg__ - Contains useful registry files

__Themes__ - Has many official, beta, and unreleased themes from Microsoft, as well as the 3D XP Flag screensaver from Plus! for Windows XP.
