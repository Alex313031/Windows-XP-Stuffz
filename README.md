# Windows-XP-Stuffz
Files for Windows XP that are hard to find because Microsoft took them down.

EXFAT_DRIVER - Adds native exfat support (reading, writing, formatting with format dialog).

IE8_INSTALL is Internet Explorer 8 x86 for win xp

IE_8_CUMULATIVE - is all updates in one WSU package.

MP10Setup - is WMP 10, because some (like me) don't like WMP 11. This package is slightly different from the WMP10 still available in Microsoft's update catalog, as it is windows xp specific, which shows in the fact it is slightly larger than the one for vista.

MSIEXEC_4.5 - latest version of windows installer (XP Sp3 comes with 3.0)

MTPPK12 - Backports MTP support to XP, note that It will not work at all with WMP9, Works for VIEWING only with WMP10, and that to have all features like write support to devices, you need WMP11. Hence, be careful with choosing this and the WMP10 package.

rktools.exe - Windows 2003 resource kit tools, works just fine on XP, as there was never a resource kit for xp released publicly (though there was a small subset of these released in a small resource kit that one could order with a technet subscription).

SysinternalsSuite.zip - Older version of sysinternals suite that still works with XP (approximated by using web.archive.org to find one with process explorer that would run on xp, and since I didn't look at ALL the snapshots, there may be slightly newer versions that work with xp, but anything after mid 2015 wont work for many of the tools)

WANNACRY_PATCH - The strange singular patch that Miscrosoft released years after Xp's end of support.

WMITools - Old WMI developer package. Works with 2000 and Vista, and 7 with compatability mode and opening the HTML based tools in IE (because it uses active content, blocked by modern browsers)

Powertoys - Windows XP Powertoys 2005 (last version)
